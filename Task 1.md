# Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program 
## Task 1 - Data Preparation And Customer Analytics 
### Background
One of the client, Category Manager for Chips, wants to have a better understanding on who their target customers are and what their purchasing behaviors are. As a data analyst in the Quantium’s retail team, the goal for us is to **get a supermarket’s strategic plan** for the chip category in the next half year by considering what metrics would be helpful to describe the customers’ purchasing behavior.

### What we want to know
- Who spends on chips?
- What drives spends for each customers segment 

### How to get 

### Summary of the data — data cleaning and analyzing 
We are given 2 datasets — the transaction data and purchase behaviors. Since we are only focus on the chips product, we remove transactions of other products from the dataset. That is over 74K transactions as our data size. Customers can be identified by their lifestage (e.g. single/couples/families etc) and their membership status (e.g. budget/mainstream/premium).
